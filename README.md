# SDFPricing

This is a package in the Julia programming language to perform asset pricing based on a stochastic discount factor in continuous time. Prices are computed through Monte Carlo simulations according to a pricing partial differential equation and the corresponding Feynman-Kac formula. At this stage it is possible to compute a) prices of zero-coupon fixed income securities and b) price-dividend ratios, which also allow the calculation of prices and returns of dividend-paying securities. The functionality of the package is illustrated in the provided examples.
